# Kalena's Bakery
Link: https://sualee0.github.io/kalena-bakery-website/ 

By: Meliora Ho, Jade Lin, and Emily Lee

Our group created this project as an online bakery website inspired by Emily's cousin, Kalena's baking business. While the website is not fully functional yet (shopping cart and order placement), the site showcases her baked goods/products and serves as a concept for her future online presence.

Pages Created:

- Emily - Homepage
- Meliora - Products Page, Shopping Cart, Checkout, and all JS scripts
- Jade - Individual Product Pages w/ Reviews, 404

    - [To open navbar, shopping cart, and filter products based on different sections](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_addeventlistener.asp)
    - To reuse the content-section components in 'Products' & add interactivity to the shopping cart:

Note:

- We went to office hours, and Al Pagar said that our shopping cart component is considered as a content area.
- Due to the scope of the final project requirements, global state management is not implemented. Thus, products added to the shopping cart will not be stored and the products in the checkout page are static.
