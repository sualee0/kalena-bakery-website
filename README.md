Note:
- Since this bakery does not have an online presence, the social media bar in the footer is there for aesthetics. It doesn't lead to any social media for this bakery.  
- Due to the scope of the final project requirements, the shopping cart is more like a static component. If you add to cart a product, chocolate chip cookies will still be there as a placeholder, and the Checkout button will not lead you to anywhere.
